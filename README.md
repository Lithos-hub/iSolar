# iSolar

This is a project I'm developing in parallel to my training with the Three.js Bruno Simon's course, trying to apply as much as possible about what has been learned.

I'm trying to create a scale model of our solar system in a interactive way.

# Tech stack

This app is being developing using only Three.js and Vite. In addition, there are some dependencies installed such as dat.gui and gsap.
